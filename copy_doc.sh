# This script converts the shared Roadmap documentation into the Markdown format
# needed by Jekyll to render the page correctly. The script doc_to_page.py
# contains most of the processing, which focuses on formatting the table of
# contents, headers, and equations correctly.
#
# Requirements:
#   - pandoc
#   - gh-md-toc (https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc)
