## Introduction
The ICCT’s Roadmap model is a global transportation emissions model
covering all on-road vehicle activity in over 190 countries. The Roadmap
model is intended to help policymakers worldwide to identify and
understand trends in the transportation sector, assess emission impacts
of different policy options, and frame plans to effectively reduce
emissions of both greenhouse gases (GHGs) and local air pollutants. It
is designed to allow transparent, customizable estimation of
transportation emissions for a broad range of policy cases.

Making use of the ICCT’s comprehensive understanding of worldwide
transportation policies, the model provides annual estimates of both
current emissions and future emissions under currently adopted policies
out to 2050. Roadmap estimates historical and projected fuel lifecycle
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as well as 15 local air pollutants. The model
includes six vehicle types and four fuel types.

Many of the key model inputs are sourced from the IEA Mobility Model
(MoMo)’s June 2020 version. Additional country-specific data is included
for key regions where available. Using sales inputs from MoMo and
calibrated survival curves, Roadmap’s turnover module first compiles a
detailed inventory of vehicle stock. Applying per-vehicle mileage rates
and energy intensities from MoMo, the model next calculates detailed
energy consumption estimates. These, in turn, are the key input to the
final emissions calculations. This document describes the inputs and
methods used in each major calculation step as well as some additional
optional components available to users.

## Sales
Annual vehicle sales are the main driver of vehicle stock within
Roadmap. MoMo provides historical sales data for 45 regions, including
31 individual countries.

### Historical sales

For countries within aggregate MoMo regions, new vehicle sales are
disaggregated based on each country’s share of energy consumption within
the region. Energy balances are derived from IEA’s World Energy Balances
2017 edition, which covers road transport energy consumption by fuel
type from 1971-2015. For years after 2015, the relative 2015 shares are
applied. Based on the relative amounts of fuel consumption in the World
Energy Balances, Roadmap disaggregates vehicle sales into 4 technology
types: diesel, gasoline, natural gas, and electric. Historical sales for
several countries are updated using local data.

### Projected sales

Sales are projected using compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) which
have been calibrated to projected vehicle activity growth rates. For EU
regions, activity growth rates are derived from the [EU Reference
Scenario 2016](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/data-analysis/energy-modelling/eu-reference-scenario-2016_en).
For the rest of the world, MoMo growth rates are used. The following
equation is used to project sales for each country (\\(C\\)) and vehicle
type (\\(V)\\):

$$\text{Sales}_{C,\ V,y2} = \text{Sales}_{C,V,y1}\  \times \left( \ 1 + \text{CAGR}_{C,V,G} \right)^{y2 - y1}$$

Where:

  - \\(y1\\) = The first year of the growth period

  - \\(y2\\) = The second year of the growth period

  - \\(G\\) = The growth period \\(y1\\) to \\(y2\\)

In all cases, the first \\(y1\\) is the model base year (2018). For some
countries and vehicles multiple growth periods are used, in which case
the calculation is performed again for the next growth period but using
the original \\(y2\\) as the new start year. For example, a region that
has CAGRs defined for 2018-2030, 2030-2040, and 2040-2050 will result in
projected sales for 2030, 2040, and 2050. Finally, intermediate years
are linearly interpolated.

### Used vehicle imports

Roadmap includes default data quantifying total imports of used vehicles
and estimates their characteristics based on country-specific import
policies. The top vehicle-importing regions are Africa (excluding South
Africa), the Middle East (excluding Israel), Latin America (excluding
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), Japan, Russia, and New Zealand. It should
be noted, however, that data on used vehicle flows is sparse and often
lacks detail on vehicle types and final destinations. For example, a
large quantity of used vehicles imported to the United Arab Emirates are
quickly re-exported to African countries
([UNEP, 2020](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/global-trade-used-vehicles-report))
and as a result may be reported as imports to both the United Arab
Emirates and the final destination. Roadmap accounts for used vehicle
exports by adjusting vehicle survival rates.

To support flexibility in modeling used vehicle imports, Roadmap treats
used sales as an annual share of total sales. (Alternatively, users can
specify the share of used sales compared to new sales, as is done for
intra-EU trade as discussed below.) Users can therefore provide the
model with alternate data for new sales, used sales, or total sales
individually without needing to adjust the other assumptions.

As per Ecologic
([Ecologic, 2020](https://www.ecologic.eu/sites/files/publication/2020/2632-01_ecologicisi_usedvehiclesstocktrade_march2020.pdf))
Intra-EU trade is largely from Western European countries such as
Germany, France, Netherlands etc. to Eastern European countries such as
Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. EU countries are also allowed to export
vehicles to select non-EU neighbors such as Serbia, Turkey, and Albania.
Passenger cars are the most imported used vehicle. Most countries will
consider the amount of air pollution that is generated by an imported
vehicle when calculating their registration tax, and some countries such
as Finland, Hungary, and Serbia outright ban import of vehicles that do
not adhere to certain EU pollution standards (Generally at least Euro 3
for passenger vehicles, and Euro 5 for commercial vehicles). The
Ecologic report also estimates the volume of used vehicles imported by a
certain country (2017 being the year of estimate), and this volume is
used in conjunction with the new vehicle sales data from the model to
obtain a used/new sales ratio for each country and vehicle type, which
is assumed to be constant going into the future.

Vehicle age is necessary for year-over-year turnover calculations and
estimating the control technologies and is determined one of several
ways:

1.  Based on the maximum age limit set by some vehicle-importing
    countries

2.  Based on the minimum Euro standard set by some vehicle-importing
    countries

3.  Based on the average age specified in the used vehicle imports data
    set

4.  Based on default ages for countries with no specific input data

See the emission standards section below for more details on determining
vehicle age.

Because vehicle imports are highly variable year to year, the model
assumes that future shares of new versus used vehicle sales is an
average of the 5 most recent years of data. This share is assumed to
remain constant for all projected years, however users may provide
alternate shares to replace the default assumptions.

## Stock turnover
Roadmap keeps track of the age distribution of the fleet at every
timestep based on new vehicle sales, the import age of used vehicles,
and region and vehicle specific retirement rates. There are two methods
used to estimate stock turnover, one for EU countries and another for
all other regions.

### From-age-zero

From-age-zero survival curves represent the fraction of vehicles
surviving from the original sales year. For used vehicles this means
that the survival rates are not set based on age, but rather how long
the vehicle has been in the country. These survival curves are modeled
using Weibull distributions (see [Hao et al.
(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226620148_Vehicle_survival_patterns_in_China)
for more details).

Survival curves are defined:

$${e^{- \left( \frac{x}{\lambda} \right)}}^{k}$$

Where:

  - \\(x\\) = Age of vehicle

  - \\(\lambda\\) = Steepness parameter

  - \\(k\\) *= Shape parameter = 5*

![](/roadmap-doc/assets/faz_surv.svg)  
The steepness parameter is calibrated using historical stock and sales
inventories. Most regions calibrate the from-age-zero survival curves
using stock and sales data from the MoMo database, however some regions
use more detailed national inventories for recent years. Therefore, for
each country (\\(C\\)) and vehicle type (\\(V)\\), the vehicle stock in a
calendar year (\\(CY)\\) of a given model year (\\(\text{MY}\\)) is
calculated:

$$\text{Stock}_{CY,\ MY} = \ \text{Sales}_{\text{MY}}\  \times \ \text{Survival}_{C,\ V}(CY - MY)$$

### EU countries and year-over-year turnover

The alternate method for estimating fleet turnover uses year-over-year
survival curves. These curves represent the fraction of vehicles
surviving from one year to the next. To be used effectively, a
comprehensive inventory of the fleet broken down by age should be given
for the base year. Unlike the from-age-zero survival curve method, used
vehicles are actually treated as the age they are and not considered
"new" when they enter a fleet. In this case, for each country (\\(C\\))
and vehicle type (\\(V)\\), the vehicle stock in a calendar year (\\(CY)\\)
of a given model year (\\(\text{MY}\\)) is calculated:

$$\text{Stock}_{CY,\ MY} = \ \text{Stock}_{CY - 1,\ MY}\  \times \ \text{Survival}_{C,\ V}(CY - MY)$$

In the case of age zero vehicles (CY = MY) sales are used instead of the
previous year’s stock:

$$\text{Stock}_{CY,\ MY} = \ \text{Sales}_{\text{MY}}\  \times \ \text{Survival}_{C,\ V}(0)$$

## Mileage
Total vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) is calculated by multiplying the
number of vehicles in the stock by the average annual mileage, based on
vehicle type and country. Per-vehicle mileage rates are assumed to
remain constant in future years.

### Mileage degradation

Optionally, an age-based mileage adjustment can be made which applies
mileage degradation curves to the fleet. This will not significantly
change total VKT but shifts mileage to newer vehicles.

### Scrappage policies

Roadmap can also model policies that are designed to limit the number of
certain types of vehicles (typically older, more polluting, vehicles) on
the road. While these policies may have an effect on vehicle stock, the
target of these policies is vehicle activity and so are only modeled as
affecting VKT. Typically, these policies are either scrappage policies
and low-emission zones.

The key premise is that these policies are modeled as changes in the
distribution of VKT across the fleet as opposed to changes in stock.
Therefore, any scrappage of older vehicles (that would have traveled a
certain amount of VKT) results in an equivalent increase in VKT of newer
vehicles. This module takes as input a percent of VKT for a vehicle
population (based on any of age, range, standard, vehicle type, fuel
type) that should be reassigned to newer vehicles. Users can also
specify the fuel type and model year of the vehicles that receive the
shifted activity.

## Vehicle efficiency
Roadmap’s default data includes vehicle- and powertrain-specific fuel
economy for historical model years. The fuel economy database contains
vehicle and fuel types that are more detailed than Roadmap’s vehicle and
fuel categories but less detailed than Roadmap’s individual countries.
Average fuel economy is first determined by calculating the
sales-weighted average for new vehicles, using sales volumes from the
same database. Individual countries within each aggregate region are
assigned the same energy intensity values.

Because many regions have little or no EV sales for each vehicle type,
the energy intensity of EVs is determined separately. Instead of trying
to extrapolate from the incomplete fuel economy data, we assume EV
energy intensity is just a fixed fraction of ICE energy intensity. The
fraction is based on gasoline vehicles of the same type for MC and PC,
and diesel vehicles of the same type for all others.

| Vehicle | ICE fuel | EV efficiency fraction |
| ------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| MC      | Gasoline | 0.22                   |
| PC      | Gasoline | 0.26                   |
| LCV     | Diesel   | 0.26                   |
| MDT     | Diesel   | 0.24                   |
| HDT     | Diesel   | 0.23                   |
| Bus     | Diesel   | 0.23                   |

Fuel economy is projected by applying annualized changes in energy
intensity for each vehicle type out to 2030 for 16 world regions
(defined in the model as RoadmapRegion). Annual rates of efficiency
improvements are the same for all ICE vehicles. These inputs reflect
annualized reductions in real-world fuel consumption (after applying
on-road adjustment / CO2 gap). No efficiency improvements are assumed
from 2030 to 2050.

The ICCT additionally estimates annual energy intensity improvements
(2020 to 2030) for China and Japan based on currently adopted policies.

## Emissions
### Emissions standards

On-road emissions are heavily dependent on the emissions control
technologies of the vehicle fleet. The Roadmap model contains a
frequently updated database of emission control regulations for 75
countries and the EU. Roadmap assumes that from the year a regulation
takes effect onward, all new vehicles are sold with the required
emission control technologies. (For more on how Roadmap accounts for
tampered/degraded controls, see High emitters below.) Emission standards
are classified based on their closest equivalents within the Euro, US,
or China emission standard categories.

The emission standards of imported vehicles are harder to determine.
Many countries have policies that restrict old or dirty vehicles. The
three cases in Roadmap models are:

1.  A complete ban of used vehicle imports

2.  Restrictions based on vehicle's age

3.  Restrictions based on vehicle's standard

In case 1, the country cannot import used vehicles at all, so all
vehicles follow the same emission standard timeline. In case 2, it is
conservatively assumed that all imported vehicles are the maximum age
allowed. The import year and import age are used to calculate the model
year of the entering vehicles. The vehicle’s model year is matched to
the emission standard timeline of the *exporting* country, which is used
as the standard for all vehicle imports that year. If no export country
is specified, it is assumed that vehicles are sourced from a region
following the EU timeline. If multiple export countries are given, the
timeline is taken from the country with the greatest share of the
exports.

In the third case the emission standard is restricted to the standard
given by the country’s policies. Using the reverse process used in case
2, this standard is used to estimate the age of the entering vehicle.
Similarly, it is conservatively assumed that all imported vehicles are
the maximum age that still comply with the control standard.

In all cases, Roadmap assumes the emissions performance of used vehicle
imports is equivalent to or worse than new vehicles.

### Emission factors

Tailpipe emission factors are primarily sourced from the European
Environment Agency’s European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP)
and the Handbook Emission Factors for Road Transport (HBEFA) with the
exception of the USA and China. Electric and other zero-emission
vehicles are assumed to emit no air pollutants. Currently the Roadmap
model does not estimate non-exhaust emissions such as brake and tire
wear.

As both HBEFA and EMEP provide emission factors for a larger variety of
vehicle types and weight classes than Roadmap, we first aggregate the
emission factors to the Roadmap categories. The emission factors for 19
countries are aggregated with local, up-to-date stock inventories. HBEFA
emission factors are used for buses and include a weighting of urban vs.
intercity buses in addition to vehicle weight class. Emission factors
for other vehicle types are sourced from EMEP, however the additional
detail by weight class is only given for trucks. All other countries
that follow the EU timeline use emission factors based on the average
fleet composition from the EU countries with available data.

The USA and Canada follow emission control regulations developed by the
EPA. The EPA’s MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) estimates
diesel, gasoline, and natural gas emission factors for vehicles
following the US standards. Newer heavy-duty vehicles in Mexico are
assumed to be partially sourced from the USA and thus are assigned a
weighted emission factor of US 2010 and Euro VI values. China-specific
emission factors are taken from the ICCT’s China model which are based
on data from the Vehicle Emission Control Center and Tsinghua
University.

Further adjustments are made to the PM and NOx emission factors
certified to US and EU regulatory pathways based on real-world
performance data, including remote sensing measurements, recent PEMS
testing, and planned updates to MOVES. Roadmap also supports additional
speciation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> for all regions into components BC, OC,
non-carbon organic matter, NO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>, elemental
metals, and unspeciated PM, based on Table C-1 and Table C-3 of
[MOVES2014](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_file_download.cfm?p_download_id=525697&Lab=OTAQ).

### High emitters

Emission factors derived from the models above are based on emission
control technologies performing under various driving conditions. In
addition, Roadmap accounts for high emitters—vehicles whose emissions
control systems are malfunctioning as a result of tampering, poor
maintenance, or failure. These vehicles produce emissions substantially
higher than regulatory limits. High emitter effects currently considered
in this model are limited to PM and NO<sub>X</sub> emissions from diesel
vehicles.

Roadmap includes estimates of the shares of high-emitting vehicles for
eight countries, the EU, and the rest of the world, based on
region-specific estimates and general compliance and enforcement level
for PM and NO<sub>X</sub>. An emissions multiplier is used for each
control level to determine the emission factors of the broken
technologies.

As tampering, malfunction and mal-maintenance affects emissions based on
the vehicle’s age, we follow EMFAC and MOVES’s approach to estimate high
emitters’ emission deterioration. As shown in the figure below, this
approach models a linear increase in emission rate from end of the
warranty period up to the useful life age. As in MOVES, we define the
point of age at the end of emission warranty period and end of useful
life as warranty age and useful life age. The share and multiplier we
define correspond to the condition at and after useful life age.

Mileage was converted to age based on region-specific data that show how
quickly different types of vehicles accumulate miles. We use TRACCS data
for the EU and activity from VECC for China, which is also consistent
with the estimate from Huo et al. [Huo et
al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.09.019)(). We use the
same ages for the US as in MOVES. In addition, we distinguish warranty
and useful life ages by control level. For example, China only starts to
have warranty requirements in China VI, and more recent standards, for
example, China VI, Euro VI and US2004+, require longer useful life.

MOVES2014 technical report.

### Sulfur effects

Fuel sulfur effects on sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub>) and sulfur dioxide
(SO<sub>2</sub>) running emissions apply [MOVES2014a
methods](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P100O5W2.pdf)
(equations 9-1 and 9-3).

$$\text{SO}_{2}\left( g \right) = \ \text{FC}\left( g \right)\  \times \ \lbrack S\rbrack\left( \text{ppm} \right) \times \ \frac{\text{MW}_{\text{SO}_{2}}\ }{\text{MW}_{S}}\  \times \ f\text{SO}_{2}\  \times \ \left( \frac{10^{6}}{\text{ppm}} \right)$$

Where:

  - \\(\text{FC}\left( g \right)\ \\) = fuel consumption (grams)

  - \\(\lbrack S\rbrack\left( \text{ppm} \right)\ \\) = fuel-sulfur level
    (ppm)

  - \\(\frac{\text{MW}\_{\text{SO}\_{2}}\ }{\text{MW}\_{S}}\\) = the ratio of
    molecular weight of sulfur dioxide to sulfur = 2.0

  - \\(f\text{SO}\_{2}\\) = Fraction of fuel sulfur that is converted to
    gaseous SO<sub>2</sub> emissions (1 - fraction converted to
    SO<sub>4</sub>).

This equation simplifies to:

$$\text{SO}_{2}\left( g \right)\  = \ \text{FC}(g)\  \times \ \text{SO}_{2}\ \text{EF}\ (g/\text{ppm})\  \times \ S(\text{ppm})$$

where \\(\text{SO}\_{2}\text{EF}\\) is the emission factor specific to HDVs
and LDVs by emission control technology.

SO<sub>4</sub> emissions are calculated:

$${\text{SO}4}_{x} = \text{NonECPMB}\  \times \ S_{B}\  \times \ \left\lbrack 1 + \ F_{B}\  \times \ \left( \frac{x}{x_{B}} - 1 \right) \right\rbrack$$

Where:

  - \\(\text{NonECPMB}\\) = the reference non-elemental carbon
    PM<sub>2.5</sub> emission rate

  - \\(S\_{B}\\) = the sulfate reference fraction

  - \\(x\\) = the user-supplied fuel sulfur level

  - \\(x\_{B}\\) = the reference fuel sulfur level

  - \\(F\_{B}\\) = the percentage of sulfate originating from the fuel
    sulfur in the reference case

  - \\({SO4}\_{x}\\) = sulfate emissions at the user-supplied fuel sulfur
    level

The \\(S_{B}\\), \\(F_{B}\\), and \\(x\_{B}\\), parameters vary by vehicle
type, model year group, and emission process.

### Biodiesel effects

Roadmap can also optionally model the impact of biodiesel blends on
NO<sub>X</sub> and PM emissions. Emission multipliers developed by the
ICCT take into account country-specific differences in feedstock, fuel
sulfur level, and biodiesel blend level. Currently, biodiesel effects
are only available for the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil.

### CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

Unlike other pollutants which are technology specific, CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions are calculated based on the carbon intensities of fuels.
Additionally, the scope of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions includes
well-to-tank (WTT) emissions in addition to tailpipe tank-to-wheel (TTW)
emissions. Combining the two gives full well-to-wheel (WTW)
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

For gasoline, diesel, and natural gas, the following values are used for
all regions:

| Fuel     | Unit | TTW CO<sub>2</sub> | WTT CO<sub>2</sub> | WTW CO<sub>2</sub> |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Gasoline | g/MJ | 72.44              | 21                 | 93.44              |
| Diesel   | g/MJ | 74.86              | 20                 | 94.86              |
| Gas      | g/MJ | 62.68              | 7                  | 69.68              |

The carbon intensity of electricity is sourced from the IEA’s World
Energy Outlook (WEO) 2019 report. The report estimates electricity
carbon intensity for 32 global regions in the years 2018, 2020, 2025,
2030, 2035, and 2040. By default, Roadmap uses the WEO’s Sustainable
Development Scenario, which assumes significant decarbonization of
electricity grid. Since WEO projects electricity carbon intensity only
out to 2040, Roadmap extrapolates the annual improvements in electricity
carbon intensity from the period 2035-2040 until 2050 but caps the
maximum reduction at 95% from 2018 levels. Any electricity consumption
before 2018 uses the 2018 values.

## Policies and scenarios
The Roadmap model is designed to explore the implications of national
and regional policies. Users can provide inputs defining alternate
scenario pathways or updating baseline assumptions.

Scenarios can define the following inputs:

| Input                        | Description                                                                                                                 |
